Data collected with OpenTag3

X axis pointing north.

Did rotations assuming NED (x-north, y-east, z-down) and right hand rule (point thumb along positive direction, and postive rotation is direction fingers curl).

Rotated X +90 then -90 then back to 0.
Rotated Y +90 then -90 then back to 0.
Rotated Z +90 then -90 then back to 0.


mag_offset.csv contains data from tag rotated in all 3 directions so that offset on magnetometer can be calculated
gyro_offset.csv contains data from tag sitting still so that offset on gyroscope can be calculated
